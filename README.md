# What is this repository for?

An OpenSSH server designed to be deployed with Docker Compose.
Personally, I use this because I wanted to give SSH access to my friends
to my personal laptop, but at the same time didn't want them to be able to
view my personal files. Thus, I decided to let them SSH into a Docker container instead.
